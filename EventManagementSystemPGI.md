Organizing events has never been easy, especially when hiring an event planner is expensive. Many people lack experience in handling events, and managing both the internal and external aspects of an event can be  time-consuming. To address this issue, our team is developing an event management system designed to simplify event organization and management. Our system includes features that make managing an event straightforward, allowing users to focus more on their events rather than stressing over the planning process.

making it more accessible. It will include online payment options, agenda scheduling, and features for managing

and login forms. The system will also handle venue booking, seating arrangements, and staff allocation, improving 
accessibility, and the overall attendee experience.
