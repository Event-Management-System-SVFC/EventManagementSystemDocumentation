## A. Introduction

## B. Project Features and Characteristics
The proposed project Event management system consists of the following features:
1. Payment methods for client and users.
2.  Agenda scheduling for locations, event planning, update schedule and customization.
3.  User registration and login.
4.  VRC Management for arrangement of bookings.

## C. Project Scope

The Event Management System (EMS) is proposed to help organizers and user efficiently manage and participate in events. The system will cover event details such as scheduling, venue booking, attendee registration, and payment processing. It aims to support organizers by providing accurate data, simplifying event planning, and improving the overall attendee experience through digitalization. The EMS will be available to event organizers, staff, and user to ensure smooth communication and coordination during events.

The Event Management System will enable event organizers to create and manage multiple events, book venues, handle seating arrangements, and allocate resources efficiently. Attendees will be able to register for events, view personalized schedules, and make online payments. However, the EMS will focus on facilitating in-person events and will not support hosting virtual events at this stage. Additionally, the system will not offer features for large-scale virtual conferencing or event streaming.
